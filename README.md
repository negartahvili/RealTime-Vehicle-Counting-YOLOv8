# 🚗 Real-time Vehicle Counting & Traffic Analysis using YOLOv8

This project implements an automated system for detecting and counting vehicles in urban traffic environments. Leveraging the **YOLOv8** (You Only Look Once) deep learning architecture, the system can identify various vehicle types and provides a foundation for intelligent traffic management systems.

### 📅 Project Overview
- **Objective**: Automate vehicle counting to analyze traffic density.
- **Model**: YOLOv8 (Pre-trained on COCO dataset / or Custom Trained).
- **Frameworks**: Python, PyTorch, Ultralytics, OpenCV.

### 🧠 Technical Highlights
- **Object Detection**: High-speed detection of cars, trucks, and buses.
- **Inference Pipeline**: Processing video frames and static images with bounding box overlays and class labels.
- **Data Visualization**: Real-time display of detection confidence scores.

### 🛠 How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install ultralytics opencv-python`.
3. Open `Vehicle_Counting_YOLOv8.ipynb` in Google Colab or locally.
